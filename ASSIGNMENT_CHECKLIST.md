## ðŸ’¬ If You Encounter Sandbox Limitations

**This is EXPECTED and OKAY!**

Document it like this:

### Example Write-Up:

> **AWS Sandbox Limitations Encountered**
> 
> When attempting to send messages via AWS, I encountered sandbox mode restrictions:
> 
> **For SES (Email):**
> - Status: Sandbox mode
> - Issue: Can only send to verified email addresses
> - What I did: Verified my personal email address
> - Result: Successfully sent test email to my verified address
> - Screenshot: [Show verified email and received message]
> 
> **For SNS (SMS):**
> - Status: Sandbox mode  
> - Issue: Can only send to verified phone numbers
> - What I did: Verified my phone number in SNS console
> - Result: Successfully sent test SMS to my verified number
> - Screenshot: [Show verified number and received SMS]
> 
> **Production Access Request:**
> - Submitted request for production access
> - Reason: To send to any email/phone without verification
> - Status: Pending (requires 24-48 hour review)
> - Screenshot: [Show request confirmation]
> 
> **Code Implementation:**
> Even though sandbox limits testing, my code is production-ready:
> - Error handling for sandbox restrictions
> - Clear error messages explaining what to do
> - Support for both verified (sandbox) and unverified (production) sending
> 
> **Learning Outcome:**
> I now understand that AWS uses sandbox mode to prevent spam and requires verification before allowing mass sending. This is a security best practice that protects users.
